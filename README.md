# TypeScript Type Declarations for Adobe FrameMaker (ExtendScript)

Contains all definitions up to FrameMaker 2019.

For newer functions, the version it was introduced will be noted at the top of the function.

## How to Use

To make use of this, click the green `Code` button near the top, then select `Download zip`.

Then create a folder in the root of your ExtendScript project folder called `types` and extract the zip into that.

Now open your project's root folder in Visual Studio Code and enjoy autocomplete, type checking, and more!
